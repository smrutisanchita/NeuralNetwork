In this project, Rossmann's store sales dataset of nearly 3 years is used to predict future sales. Many Deep learning models like Deep Dense models were implemented in Tensorflow and Keras. However, the implementation of Long short-term memory (LSTM ) Model resulted in promising accuracy in the Kaggle scoreboard.
